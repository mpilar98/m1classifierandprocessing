% Function description:
% mhd = vectorized_MHD (setA,setB)
% it takes as inputs two sets of n-dimensional points (#samples, #dimensions)
% and returns the MHD between the two sets.
%
% The vectorized implementation is computationally more efficient than the
% for-loop version at the cost of ram memory.
